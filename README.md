# USC-Projects
This repo contains projects in R and Python that I completed during my undergraduate course work at USC. 
The R code contains various forecasting and ML models, and I was comparing the different models to see which was the best for the given data.
The Python code contains some basic Python projects (my first ever projects, using functions, classes, etc.) and some ML projects.
